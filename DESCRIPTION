Description: The R-package variantscanR enables the filtering of variant call format (VCF file) files for the presence of known disease-causing variants. 
    In addition to the main variant-filtering function, the package allows for the estimation of genetic diversity using both single and multisample VCF files. 
    User-defined, file-specific options are available for the quality control of certain parameters using online database screening. 
    Finally, next to the filtering of known disease-causing variants, an additional step is optional to gather the remaining variants located within the genes of interest. 
    The R package is not species-specific and parallel computing is possible for some functions, demanding more computational power.
